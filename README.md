# üß∞ auto-fix-return.nvim
Adds or removes parenthesis from Golang return defintions as you type. 

Supports 
- Single returns 
- Multi returns 
- Named returns 
- Functions
- Methods
- Lambdas
- Interfaces

and hopefully all combinations of the above. If you find a bug please report it as an issue. 

> [!NOTE]
> The plugin attempts to add parenthesis as you type. Which means that its mostly working off of invalid parse trees.
> This is very nice to use but makes it difficult to cover all edgecases from a parsing standpoint, as different error states of the tree can be matched incorectly. 
> If you find an error state that is not covered please report it as an issue. 
> 
> You can run the command `AutoFixReturnDisable` to turn off the autocommnd and make whatever changes you need to that line. 
> Then reenable the plugin with `AutoFixReturnEnable` and the line will not be edited again unless you touch the declaration again.
